#  Drink Finder

The biggest driving force behind this app was to showcase my ability to use and manipulate a RESTful API. As I was browsing throught APIs I was looking for information that would be fun to work with but also useful. When I came across the Cocktail API I knew I had found a project that would both benefit my skills as a developer and add some usefulness to my personal life and those around me!

Working with this API was quite different from other APIs I've worked with in the fact that the documentation only offered callable endpoints instead of giving access to all the API information with one "home" or "base" URL. This required me to be a big creative when I would call each endpoint and how I would have to manipulate that data to offer the user a smooth experience when looking for a drink to make.
